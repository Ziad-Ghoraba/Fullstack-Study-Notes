**Covariance** is to pass a derived class when a base class was expected.

We need this because you often want to plug a method into a delegate even though the method’s parameters/return type are **slightly different** (child/base types) .. Instead of throwing an error, C# allows this automatically using covariance & contravariance.

```CS
class Animal { public string Name => "Animal"; }
class Dog : Animal { public string Name2 => "Dog"; }

public delegate Animal AnimalCreator();

class Program {
	// returns a more specific type (Dog)
    static Dog CreateDog() { 
        Console.WriteLine("CreateDog() called");
        return new Dog();
    }

    static void Main() {
	    // Covariance happens here
        AnimalCreator creator = CreateDog;  
		
		// You get Dog, stored as Animal
        Animal a = creator(); 
    }
}
```
***
**Contravariance**: you are allowed to **accept a less derived type** (base) where a derived type is expected.

```CS
class Animal { }
class Dog : Animal { }

public delegate void DogHandler(Dog d);

class Program {
	// more general parameter
    static void HandleAnimal(Animal a) { 
        Console.WriteLine("Handling an Animal (could be a Dog).");
    }

    static void Main() {
	    // Contravariance happens here
        DogHandler handler = HandleAnimal;   
        handler(new Dog()); // Safe: Dog is an Animal
    }
}
```
