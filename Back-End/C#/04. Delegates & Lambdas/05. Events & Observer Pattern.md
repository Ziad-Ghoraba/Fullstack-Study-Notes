The Observer Pattern has **two roles**:

1. **Subject (Publisher)**  
    Something that happens .. like a YouTube channel uploading a video.
2. **Observer (Subscriber)**  
    Something that wants to know when that thing happens .. like a user receiving a notification.

```CS
public delegate void VideoUpload(string title);

public class YouTubeChannel {
	public VideoUpload videoUpload;
	
	public void UploadVideo(string videoTitle) {
		Console.WriteLine($"New Video Uploaded {videoTitle}");
		videoUpload(videoTitle);
	}
}

public class Subscriber {
	public void Subscribe(YouTubeChannel channel) {
		channel.VideoUpload += WatchVideo;
	}
	
	public void WatchVideo(string videoTitle) {
		Console.WriteLine($"User Watch Video {videoTitle}");
	}
}
```
***
The problem in our design is that **someone could access the delegate from outside** directly without calling the method because the delegate is public ... so we should use the **event keyword** to prevent access and prevent invoke the delegate from outside the class methods. 

```CS
// We want to prevent this
channel.videoUpload = null;  
```
