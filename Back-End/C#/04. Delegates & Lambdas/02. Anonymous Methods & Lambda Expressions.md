An anonymous method is simply a function **without a name**.

A **lambda expression** is a **shorter and more modern** way to write anonymous methods .. Lambdas were introduced in **C# 3.0** and replaced most anonymous method usages `(parameters) => expression_or_block`

```CS
// Without Anonymous Methods 
delegate int MathOperation(int x, int y);

internal class Program{
	static void Main(string[] args) {
		MathOperation op = Add;
		Console.WriteLine(op(5, 10));
	}

	static int Add(int a, int b) {
		return a + b;
	}
}

// With Anonymous Methods
MathOperation op = delegate(int a, int b) {
	return a + b;
};

// With Lambda Expressions
MathOperation op = (int a, int b) => a + b;
```

Anonymous functions are mostly used when:
- The function will only be used once
- You don’t want to create a separate named function
- You need to pass a function to a delegate

Why Use Lambdas? .. Because they are .. **shorter, cleaner, easier to read, used heavily in LINQ, and the modern standard in C#**.
