Indexers is the one who allows us to use index to deal with elements.

Imagine we are having two classes `Book` and `BookCollection` and the `BookCollection` have a private field which holds an array of books and we want when instantiate this `BookCollection` to be able to use indexes with this field ... here comes the Indexers into play.  

 Indexers definition is very similar to the property definition ... note that if you will be iterating over an array of books the return of the indexers definition will be Book (see the example).

```CS
internal class BookCollection {
	private Book[] books = new Book[3];

	// Indexers Definition 
	public Book this[int index] {
		get {
			return books[index];
		}
		set {
			books[index] = value;
		}
	}
}
```

If we want to implement indexers with something other than index you **can use overloading to the indexers**.
