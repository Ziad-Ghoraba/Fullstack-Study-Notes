It's not part of the `System.Collections` .. it's inside `System` directly.

A Tuple is a small container that groups multiple values together.

In tuple you can store up to 8 objects and the last one will be the **Rest** .. to access it's value you will do `Rest.Item1` ... you can create nested tuples to hold more than 8 objects.

```CS
Tuple<int> data2 = new Tuple<int>(5)
Tuple<int, string, bool> data = Tuple.Create(10, "Hello", true);

Console.WriteLine(data.Item1);  // 10
Console.WriteLine(data.Item2);  // Hello
Console.WriteLine(data.Item3);  // True
```

Problems with classic Tuple:
- You must access values by **Item1, Item2, Item3…**, which is not readable.
- Can't hold more than 8 objects.
- Not ideal for modern code style.
***
**ValueTuple** is the modern way which was Introduced in **C# 7.0** → much better than Tuple.

```CS
ValueTuple<int, string> employee = (125, "mohamed");

// Syntax (modern C#)
(int id, string name, bool isActive) user = (10, "Hamza", true);

puplic (string Name, int age) GetNameAndAge{
	return (Name, Age);
}
```

You can use the same syntax as Tuple by using `Tuple.Create()` and also access them by `Item1, Item2` and so on.

Why ValueTuple is better?
- You can name the items (`id`, `name`, `isActive`).
- Struct (Value type) → faster.
- Supported by deconstruction syntax.

```CS
var (id, name, active) = user; // Deconstruction
```

The recommended and practical use for the tuples is when you want to return more than one value from a method.

| Feature     | Tuple                      | ValueTuple                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Type        | **Class** (reference type) | **Struct** (value type)     |
| Syntax      | `Tuple<int,string>`        | `(int id, string name)`     |
| Item names  | `Item1, Item2`             | Custom names (`id`, `name`) |
| Fast?       | Slower                     | Faster                      |
