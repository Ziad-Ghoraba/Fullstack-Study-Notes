**IEnumerable** is an interface that says .. this object can be looped over using `foreach` ... any class that implements `IEnumerable` must provide one method:

```CS
IEnumerator GetEnumerator();
```

The difference between enumerable and enumerator .. that the **enumerable is the actual list in the collection** and the **enumerator** is the thing that will be iterating over the list.

Any class that implements `IEnumerable` must provide three method:
**current, MoveNext, Reset**.

If you want to create a class that implements `IEnumerator` .. you will need to implement the three methods and also you will need to have the actual list to iterate over it so you can take the list in the constructor and you will have a custom property to use it as an index `private int pos = -1`.

**Current** method should return the object that you are currently pointing at it ... **MoveNext** will increment the position and return bool if we still `< size` .. **Reset** will return the position to the initial position which is -1.
