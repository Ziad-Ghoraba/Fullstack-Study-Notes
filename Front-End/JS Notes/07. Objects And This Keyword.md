- Access: Dot notation (`obj.prop`) or bracket notation (`obj["prop"]`) ... bracket notation is used to access properties with invalid names (or valid) ... `console.log(user["country of"])`.

- Create: `new Object()` or `Object.create()`
- The new keyword is used to create a new instance of a constructor function so this allows you to create multiple object with the same structure.

```JS
  // Constructor function
  function User(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  // Creating a new instance of User using the new keyword
  let user1 = new User('Alice', 25);
```


**Creating object with create :**

 `let student = Object.create(human);` .. here it's asking for an object model to create and after it will create a similar one.

 **The different benefit is the inheritance and the composition.**
***

- Assign: `Object.assign(target, ...sources)` ... returns the target object.

- `this`: Refers to global `window` or object owning the method.
-  When a function is owned to a variable like the anonymous function .. **this** keyword will refer to this element.

```js
let user = new Object({ age: 20 });

let finalObject = Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2);
```

- Assign makes a shallow copy .. In JS a shallow copy of an object is a copy that shares the same memory reference for non-primitive types (like objects and arrays) with the original object .. this means that changes to the original object will affect the copied object and vice versa, but only for non-primitive types ... and the opposite is the deep copy.
