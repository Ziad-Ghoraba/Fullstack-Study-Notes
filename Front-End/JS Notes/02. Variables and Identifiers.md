## Variables

- Variables can be declared without keyword and they will work properly.
- The difference is:
  - Using keyword creates a **function-scoped** variable.
  - Without the keyword, it creates a **global** variable.

- If you have an element in HTML with an `id`, then you get a global variable with that name ... but this's a bad practice.

- **var**: **Can be redeclared**, Function-scoped, **hoisted with `undefined`**, added to window object (Variable Scope Drama).
- **let**: Block-scoped, no redeclare, error on access before declaration
- **const**: Block-scoped, no redeclare, **must initialize**, error on access before declaration

- Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope during the compilation phase. This means that the **declaration is moved to the top, but the assignment (if any) remains in place** .. so with var it's hoisted and initialized with undefined but with let and const it's hoisted but not initialized.  

```js
function test() {
  var x = 1; // function scope
  if (true) {
    var x = 2; // still function scope
    let y = 3; // block scope
    const z = 4; // block scope
    console.log(x); // 2
    console.log(y); // 3
    console.log(z); // 4
  }
  
  console.log(x); // 2
  console.log(y); // Error: y not defined
  console.log(z); // Error: z not defined
}
```

### Identifiers
