**Bundle Analyzer** is a tool that enables you to visualize the contents of a build to help you understand and optimize your bundles.

key questions that bundle analyzer will help you answer them:
- Why is this bundle so large?
- What are the relative sizes of each bundle in the build?
- Where is my business logic bundles?
- Are the modules I expect (included-excluded)?
- Is tree-shaking working?
- Which third-party libraries are bundled?
