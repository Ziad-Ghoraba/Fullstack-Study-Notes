**Preload** is used to initiate an early request for **late-discovered critical resources**.

Examples:
- Font files, CSS files fetched through `@import` declarations.
- CSS background-image resources are likely to be LCP candidates.

```HTML
<link rel="preload" href="/font.woff2" as="font" crossorigin>
```

The **as** attribute is the type of the resource.

In preload you need to correctly define the as attribute and add the crossorigin or the browser will send the request twice.

One hack that you can use to ensure that you won't block the parser by preloading and don't make it wait for the preload process is to add this:

```HTML
<link rel="preload" href="emoji-picker.js" as="script">
<script src="emoji-picker.js" async>
```
