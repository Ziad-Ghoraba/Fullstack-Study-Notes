**Resource Hints** are set of hints that inform the browser how to load and prioritize resources to load them faster.

Examples:
- Performing early DNS lookups.
- Connecting to servers ahead of time.
- Fetching resources before the browser would ordinarily discover them.

```HTML
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://example.com"> <!--> We will see in the next sessions how to do the same idea but with HTTP headers. 
```

Now what this code tells the browser is that when you are idle go and **prefetch the IP** for this website `example.com` and **add it to the cache** so any subsequent calls to this website **will look first for it's IP in the cache**.

And this simple step can significantly enhance loading performance for websites that open connections to many third parties ... but for normal websites this step is optimized by default.

**Preconnect** is used to establish a connection to another origin from where you are fetching critical resources.

So it won't only perform the DNS lookup ... It will:
1. DNS Lookup
2. TCP Connection
3. TLS Connection

```HTML
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googlepais.com">

<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin> 

<!--> 
crossorigin meaning: Make the request anonymously (no cookies, no auth).
```

One of the best use cases for preconnect is to **use it with google fonts**
as **google fonts recommends that you preconnect**.

Note that preconnect perform a lot of steps so you should only use it with critical resources ... also note that the connections are closed after ten seconds of inactivity, so connect only with the resources you will actually need.

You can use **dns-prefetch as a fallback for preconnect** like:

```HTML
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googlepais.com">
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://fonts.googlepais.com">
```
