Performance from the user’s perspective can be evaluated using three main metrics:

- **Load speed**
- **Responsiveness to interactions**
- **Memory usage**

Two major challenges affect front-end performance:

1. **The browser’s single-threaded nature**  
2. **Network latency**

Because JavaScript runs on a **single thread**, long tasks block the browser’s event loop.  
To keep the UI responsive, tasks must be lightweight so the browser can rapidly switch between them .. similar to a Round Robin scheduling style.

When a user navigates to a website, the browser typically goes through these steps:

1. **Redirection**  
   The user is redirected or navigated to the target page.

2. **DNS Lookup**  
   The browser resolves the domain name to an IP address.  
   Browsers cache DNS results so they don’t have to query the DNS server on every request.

3. **TCP 3-Way Handshake**  
   The client and server establish a TCP connection (SYN → SYN/ACK → ACK).

4. **TLS Negotiation**  
   If the website uses HTTPS, the browser and server negotiate encryption and agree on a cipher suite.

5. **Initial HTTP Request & Response**  
   The browser sends an HTTP GET request and begins receiving the response.

TCP Slow Start is a congestion control mechanism used to determine the client’s available bandwidth.  

It gradually increases the amount of data sent until it detects the optimal throughput without causing network congestion.
