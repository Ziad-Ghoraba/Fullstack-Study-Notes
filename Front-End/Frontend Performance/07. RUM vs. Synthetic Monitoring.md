There's two types of monitoring which are **field data & lab data**.

## Real User Monitoring (RUM)

**RUM** collects data on how **real users** interact with your website.

Captures the performance of actual users regardless of device, browser, network or geo location ... but it also makes it possible to break down the data by different categories.

Note that if you tried to capture to much insights that might lead to performance issues.

## Lab Data

simulates a user behavior in a controlled environment .. so you can use it to troubleshoot specific environment.

Note that you shouldn't use specific circumstances that's not related to the users .. like doing the tests on 5G with a MacBook and the most of your users are in Egypt :) 

You can use lab data to test your website before release.

Lab data provides more detailed reports (every request, record a filmstrip with screenshots, or console messages).
